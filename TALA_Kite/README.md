###The TALA Kite
These instructions are re-written from advice in the TALA manual. To Make a TALA kite see [TALA Assembly](TALA_assembly.md).

####TALA Kite rigging adjustment
Tow the TALA without a tail attached behind an automobile in dead air.  IF the TALA veers to the left, add one or two half hitches to the left side of the kite’s bridle (as you view it in flight).  Continue towing adjustment unti the TALA is stable at 10m/s 

Now attach a tail and tow at 15m/s.  If the TALA veers to the right, shorten the left tail bridle with one or two half hitches.  Once stability is achieved, increase speed to 25m/s and repeat.

####Kite Maintenance
The Kevlar line used for the TALA does not stretch and makes poor knots.  Because of this, it is recommended that the snap swivel on the kevlar line be reattached periodically with a new crimped fastener. 

####Kite Storage
Lay bridle on the center panel, fold side panels to the center.  Roll sides tightly to meet the center and insert tail-end first into a packing tube 1” (2.5cm) in diameter.
