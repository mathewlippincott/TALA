####Step-by-step

####Tail assembly
The TALA I bought came with two tails. The first tail is made with the same line that bridles the kite, and I think its original. it has no weight on it. The second tail is made from black line and does not appear to be original. it has a weight at the end.  All tassles are 1" x 10" strips of tyvek, tied 1" in from the side.

#####TALA Tail #1

* Length: 171.5"
* Tassels are tied at 9.5, 137, 147, 152, 155, 161, 164, and 171-- two tassels at the end

#####TALA Tail #2

* Length: 260.5"

* tassels at: 78.5, 82, 84.5, 87.5, 98.5, 229, 235.5, 242, 244.5, 249, 252, 255.5, 260.5-- two tassels on the end.
