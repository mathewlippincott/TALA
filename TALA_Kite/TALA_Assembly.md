####Step-by-step
_TBA_

####Bridling
Both the attachment bridle and tail bridle are 60" pieces of string.  Both need a 2" attachment loop tied on with a larks head knot.

####Tail assembly

#####How many tails? 
We have two original tails for the TALA which can be assumed to be described in the patent US421351.

The two tails may be two parts of a single tail, as described in the Air Force's vertical profiling procedure and elsewhere.  In this case the TALA would be flown with 1/2 tail in low winds and a full tail in high winds.

Alternatively, the two tails are two separate tails, one 1/2 length and the other full-length.

The TALA kite flies great with the shorter unweighted tail, and also flies great with the longer tail.

####Materials and Design of the Tail 

Both tails are made from the same string as the bridle and have 1" x 10" Type 1441 Tyvek tassels tied into them. Both tails are clipped to the tail bridle by means of a 14 guage snap swivel.

The first tail is made with the same line that bridles the TALA kite, and can therefore be assumed to be original.

Total Length: 171.5"

Tassels are tied below the snap swivel at 9.5", 137", 147", 152", 155", 161", 164", and two tassels at 171".

The second tail is made from black line and does not appear to be original, although its use of a weight is described in the patent. It has a weight at the end.

* Total Length: 260.5"

* A 2.3g (35 grain) lead split-shot sinker is attached at 259.5"

* Tassels are tied below the swivel at: 78.5", 82", 84.5", 87.5", 98.5", 229", 235.5", 242", 244.5", 249", 252", 255.5", 260.5"-- two tassels on the end.
