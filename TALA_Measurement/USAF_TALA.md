### USAF TALA vertical profiling procedure
For recording on [USAF TALA record sheet](TALA USAF_record_sheet.pdf)

1. Assemble reel and handle.
2. Calibrate measuring tube as described in ownerâ€™s manual.
3. Remove barometer and thermometer from carrying case and place in a sheltered location. Record temperature and pressure altitude.
4. Read fixed instrumentation if flying over such a site.
5. Launch kite to the first reel count directly over the selected site.
6. Record start time of the test.
7. Record inclination of the ridgecrest.
8. Record inclination to the kite and wind direction.
9. Record wind speed 10 times with each reading spaced by 15 seconds.
10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 one more time for a total of 20 wind speed readings.
11. Record inclination to the kite and wind direction.
12. Increase reel count for the next set of readings.
13. Return to step 7 and repeat steps 7-12 until the profile is complete.
14. Reel in the kite, again repeating steps 7-12 but now at decreasing reel counts.
15. Take final reading of fixed instrumentation if applicable.
16. Reduce data on a desktop computer or plot by hand.
