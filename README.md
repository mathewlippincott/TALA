###Introduction to the TALA
The TALA, or Tethered Aerodynamic Lifting Anemometer, is a kite and collection of ground-based sensors for measuring wind speed at the kite's altitude.  It was originally designed by Charles F. Woodhouse in 1976 and sold by Approach Fish until the late 1980's. It is covered by US patent 4152933.  It was imagined as a means of indicating local weather conditions at airports, but was largely put to use prospecting for good windmill locations.
