###Introduction to the TALA
The TALA, or Tethered Aerodynamic Lifting Anemometer, is a type of [kite wind speed meter](https://github.com/mathewlippincott/Kite-Wind-Speed-Meter). It consists of a kite and collection of ground-based sensors for measuring wind speed (anemometry) at the kite's altitude.  The kite was originally designed by Raymond P. Holland Jr. and adapted by Charles F. Woodhouse for anemometry in a product sold by Approach Fish until the late 1980's. It is covered by expired US patents 3,767,145, 4,058,010, 4,152,933 & 4,221,351.  These plans are released under the [CERN OHL 1.2](LICENSE.MD), compiling [Public Lab research](www.publiclab.org/wiki/kite-anemometers) on the TALA into a DIY kit. 

The TALA was imagined as a means of indicating local weather conditions at airports, but was largely put to use prospecting for good windmill locations.

###Elements of the TALA System
* [TALA kite](Kite_plans)
* Tension gauge for line tension
* Compass for wind direction
* Thermometer for ground temperature
* Clinometer for line angle and kite angle to ground
* Means of measuring length of line released 
* Means of calculating altitude from line angle and length of line released
* Means of adjusting altitude measurements for caternary sag of the kite line
* Means of correlating line tension with wind speed
