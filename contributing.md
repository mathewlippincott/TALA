#Contribute to the TALA replication project
This repository is one aspect of a larger effort to replicate the TALA system, as well as use and document kite anemometers of other designs. In addition, the mathematical models used by the TALA system can be put to other uses, such as predicting the lift of a kite in known winds.

You can contribute to the TALA replication project by:
 
* Replicating the TALA kit and documenting your use of it on [publiclab.org](https://publiclab.org) with the tag "[kite-anemometer](https://publiclab.org/tag/kite-anemometer)." If you record your experiences elsewhere, please contact us and share.
* Expanding our documentation of kite anemometry research and projects on [the Public Lab Wiki.](https://publiclab.org/wiki/kite-anemometers)
* Improving the documentation on kite wind speed meter models in the [Kite Wind Speed Meter](./Kite-Wind-Speed-Meter) repository, as well as adding applications of those models.
* Adding your comments to [open issues in this repository](/issues).
* Forking this repository and improving the design documentation, assembly instructions, or to add hardware or software for acquiring and interpretting data. 

#Contributing to an OPEN Open Source project repository

This is an [OPEN Open Source](http://openopensource.org/) hardware project. Please fork it and work in your own copy, and file pull requests back to the master branch. 


## What?

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. **significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing style.

## Releases

Stick to semver: Major.Minor.Patch.

## Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add or change.
